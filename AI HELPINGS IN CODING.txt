This is an excerpt explaining how we can use AI to help us in writing code 
When interacting with AI we can help the AI to understand that this is a line of code by adding three dashes before the code e.g

---
contract FundMe {

function Fund ()payable public {
require (msg.value >= 1e18, " NOT ENOUGH FUNDS " );
}
---

Some of the AI we use are
1.CHATGPT
2.PIRANHA 
3.PHIND
4.DEEPSEEK
