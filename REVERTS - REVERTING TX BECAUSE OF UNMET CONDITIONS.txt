//REVERTS 
/*What is a REVERT
A revert undoes any actions that have been done previously,and sends the remaining gas associated with that tx back
In the example below ,since we had set a revert condition i.e if the sender doesnt send >1ETH the tx will revert ,then once the function is called ,any previous actions will be undone.
e.g If sender sends <1ETH in the value section ,deploys the contract then calls the 'fund' function ,MyValue will not add +2 ,instead it will be reverted
