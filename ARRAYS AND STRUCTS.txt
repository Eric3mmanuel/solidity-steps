//ARRAYS AND STRUCTS
//ARRAYS ARE A COMMON WAY OF GROUPING DATA 
//THEY ARE ZERO INDEXED
/*E.G 
[1,2,3,4,5]-ELEMENTS
0,1,2,3,4  -INDEX
// STRUCTS (STRUCTURES IN FULL) ARE A WAY TO GROUP SEVERAL RELATED VARIABES INTO ONE PLACE
//THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN ARRAY AND A STRUCT IS THAT ,UNLIKE AN ARRAY , A STRUTURE(STRUCT) CAN CONTAIN MANY DATA TYPES E.G INT,BOOL,UINT ,ADDRESS ETC.
//EACH VARIABLE IN THE STRUCTURE IS KNOWN AS A MEMBER OF THE STRUCTURE
e.g struct person {
        uint256 personsfavnumber;-member
        string personsname;      -member
    }
//STRUCTS CREATE THEIR VARIABLES
//NOW YOU CAN CREATE A NEW VARIABLE AND ITS OWN ARRAY - person[]   
e.g person[] public personslist; 
//WE HAVE 2 TYPES OF ARRAYS 
i) STATIC ARRAYS - E.G person[3]
ii)DYNAMIC ARRAYS -E.G person[]

    SECOND
    MONA,1000(then click add person)
